Treat the document as a California Grant Deed.

Identify Deed Type from the main title text near the top, e.g., “GRANT DEED”.

Identify Recording Document ID / Number from the recorder header, labeled like “DOC# 2025000065659”.

Identify Recording County and Recorder from the header that mentions “Electronically Recorded in Official Records, County of Ventura, Ventura County Clerk‑Recorder”.

Identify Recording Date and Time from the same header line that contains the document number, date, and time (e.g., “09/15/2025 08:00 AM”).

Identify Escrow Number from any line labeled like “Escrow No.”, “Escrow #”, or “Escrow Number”.

Identify Title Number from any line labeled like “Title No.”, “Title #”, “Title Order No.”, or “Title Number”.

Identify Grantor(s) (Seller / Current Owner) from the clause:

The party name(s) immediately before the words “hereby GRANT(S) to”.

Identify Grantee(s) (Buyer / New Owner) from the clause:

The party name(s) immediately after the words “hereby GRANT(S) to”.

Interpret any phrases like “HUSBAND AND WIFE AS JOINT TENANTS” as part of the grantor vesting description, not separate names.

Interpret any phrases like “AS CO‑TRUSTEES OF THE [TRUST NAME]” as part of the grantee capacity / trust information.

Identify the Deed Date from the line beginning with “Dated:” near the signature block.

Identify the Notary Name from the acknowledgment section following the word “before me,” and the Notary County and State from the acknowledgment heading.

Identify the Notary Commission Expiration Date when present (often labeled like “My commission expires”, “Commission expires”, or similar).

Identify the APN (Assessor’s Parcel Number) from any line labeled “APN:” (e.g., “APN: 551‑0‑151‑585”).

Identify the Legal Description from Exhibit “A” or the section indicated by “SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT ‘A’”.

If Exhibit “A” contains “LOT … OF TRACT NO. …” language, treat the entire block as the legal description text.

If there is language beginning with “EXCEPT THEREFROM…”, include this as part of the legal description because it describes reserved mineral or other rights.

Identify grantor and grantee addresses when present:
- Grantor mailing address or address appearing near grantor identification/signature.
- Grantee mailing address (often “Mail tax statements to” or similar) or address appearing near grantee identification.
- If multiple grantors/grantees exist, return the best primary address (or the first clearly associated address). If no address is present, keep fields empty.

PCOR (PRELIMINARY CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP REPORT) EXTRACTION (WHEN PRESENT):
- If the documents include a PCOR form/section (keywords: “Preliminary Change of Ownership Report”, “PCOR”, “Assessor”, “Documentary Transfer Tax”, “BOE-502-A”, “Part 1”, “Part 2”, “Part 3”, “Part 4”, “Certification”), extract PCOR information in addition to grant deed fields.
- Parse the PCOR and map its contents into the structured `pcor` object below.
- PCOR commonly contains:
  - Part 1: Transfer Information
  - Part 2: Other Transfer Information
  - Part 3: Purchase Price and Terms of Sale
  - Part 4: Property Information
  - Certification
- Extract as many fields as present.
- Record checkbox/exemption selections as explicit boolean fields and/or arrays of selected codes.
- For Parts 1-4, capture both:
  - a structured interpretation (e.g., transfer type, dates, amounts)
  - and the raw checkbox selections (as a map of label -> true/false)
- CERTIFICATION (REQUIRED WHEN PCOR PRESENT):
  - If `pcor.present` is true, you MUST populate `pcor.certification` from the Certification section.
  - Extract values such as the printed name, signature text, signature date, phone number, email address, and any title/capacity label.
  - If a specific certification field is not visible, leave it empty/null, but DO NOT omit the `pcor.certification` object.
- If a PCOR field is not present, return an empty string, null, false, or an empty array/object (as appropriate), but keep the `pcor` object present in the output.

Return JSON only.
